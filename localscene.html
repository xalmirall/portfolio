                <p class="case-block-m">
                    How can we discover music on Spotify? Of course, the platform offers playlists, recommendations, suggestions, and new albums notifications. But have you ever tried to look for new bands? How was your experience?
                    <br><br>Besides that, each city brings you different vibes. Think in Nashville. What genre first comes into your head? Maybe country? Think in Barcelona or maybe New York? What artists come into your mind?
                    <br><br>Let me introduce you <b>Local Scene feature for Spotify</b>. This new feature will allow users to <b>discover artists nearby or in different locations filtering by genre</b>.
                    <br><br>I decided to design the feature on the iOS platform because I am very used to the iOS Design system. Therefore, the frames used for the design are from an iPhone 13.
                    <br><br>This feature first came to my mind responding to my specific needs. Yes, you guessed it! I'm a curious musician, and I'm constantly looking for emerging bands.
                </p>
                <h2 class="case-block-m">UX research</h2>
                <p class="case-block-m">
                    I decided to validate it quickly before moving on with the idea, applying a guerrilla research method. I interviewed five Spotify users between 20 and 40 years to understand if this feature made sense.
                    <br><br>These are some of the insights that I took and classified in the affinity diagram:

                <p class="case-block-s">
                    “I go to local clubs or search in the local area to discover local music. I don’t feel like Spotify can help me with that.”
                    <br><br>“There are situations that you are bored with listening to the same music.”

                <ul class="case-block-m">
                    <li>Interviewed users would use the Local Scene feature to discover new artists.</li>
                    <li>Users often use playlists or look at the suggestions to play new music, but they feel that Spotify can't help them discover new local artists.</li>
                    <li>Spotify makes users scroll too much to find what they are looking for. I will bear that in mind for the new feature.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="case-block-m">Feature comparison</h2>
                <p class="case-block-m">
                    Although Spotify keeps leading the market, it has slightly <a href="https://backlinko.com/spotify-users" target="_blank">decreased over the past years</a>. Therefore, this scenario is an excellent opportunity to implement this feature to engage more users and recover the lost market share.
                    <br><br>While doing market research, I realized that Bandcamp is the only competitor allowing to discover artists by location.

                <h2 class="case-block-m">Problem & hypothesys statement</h2>
                <p class="case-block-m">
                    Travis' journey brings us to the problem statement definition:
                    <br><br>Spotify local scene was designed to achieve the discovery of emerging local artists.
                </p>
                <p class="case-block-s">
                    We have observed that the playlists and radio are not meeting local music artists’ supporters’ expectations which is causing a loss of engagement of these users to Spotify business.
                </p>
                <p class="case-block-m">
                    And the hypothesis statement:

                <p class="case-block-s">
                    We believe creating city filters for local artists’ supporters will achieve a higher retention rate. We will know we are right with the increase in the retention metrics.

                <p class="case-block-m">
                    The user flow and site map helped me decide on the main screens to design. The below sketches show six key screens to complete the tasks.
                </p>
            </span>
            <div class="case-image-xl case-block-xl">

            <span class="case-block-l">
                <p class="case-block-m">
                    I tested the sketches with four users, gathering the following feedback:
                </p>
                <p class="case-block-s">
                    "The Change Location button is misleading. Does it mean that maybe the location is wrong?"
                    <br><br>"I don't see playlists. Don't the feature include playlists?"
                </p>
                <p class="case-block-m">
                    With this feedback, I started working with the mid-fi prototype. First, I changed the "Change Location" button for "Discover other cities." Then, I added curated playlists in the Local Scene screen.
                </p>
            </span>
            <div class="case-image-m case-block-m">

            <span class="case-block-l">
                <p class="case-block-m">
                    This conversion from sketches to wireframes made me rethink how I presented the information on the screen. For example, I gave more presence to the city name, added a background picture, and put the popular songs in the first place instead of the bands as Spotify is a streaming business.

                    After finishing the mid-fi prototype, I tested it with five users. Overall, the feedback was quite good, but I gathered a critical insight for the hi-fi design:
                </p>
                <p class="case-block-s">
                    “It would be nice to know if the GPS is on. I don’t see anything informing that”

                <h2 class="case-block-m">Atomic design inventory</h2>
                <p class="case-block-m">
                    Once I created and tested the sketches and mid-fi prototype, I did the Atomic Design inventory for Spotify before moving on with the hi-fi prototype. Finally, I compiled the components and their variants on Figma to design faster.
                    <br><br>Here we can see all the icons, buttons, typography, images, and colors of the Spotify app for iOS:

                    Spotify uses its typeface called Spotify Circular. Unfortunately, for copyright reasons, I had to use a fallback font. Researching the design guidelines, I decided to use Helvetica Neue, as Spotify recommends in the documentation.
                    <br><br>Combining these atoms, I could identify the molecules of the design. In addition, creating a card component with the twelve color variants helped me design the screens faster.

                    <li><b>Confirmation Screen:</b> Basically, this screen tells Travis that his current location is Terrassa. Spotify gathers this information by geolocation, as we can see in the GPS icon of the status bar. This screen is entirely new and designed from scratch. We can see a picture of the city and some bands that Travis will discover.</li>
                    <li><b>Local Scene Screen:</b> On this screen, we can see how many artists we can discover on Terrassa and all the popular local songs. Also, we can see the most listened albums, play some curated playlists based on local artists, and finally, the artists located in Terrassa and the upcoming shows in the city.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="case-block-m">
                    In this case, Travis wants to discover Punk artists, so he taps on the "Filter by genre" button.

                <p class="case-block-m">
                    But what happens if Travis wants to search for other cities? Let's move back to the search screen and click the local scene feature again.
                </p>
                <ul class="case-block-m">
                    <li><b>Confirmation Screen:</b> instead of tapping continue, Travis will tap "Discover other local scenes."</li>

                <p class="case-block-m">
                    So that's the Local Scene feature, a new way to discover music. 🎧

                    The first time this idea came to my head, it sounded good.
